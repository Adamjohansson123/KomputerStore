# Komputer Store

This is a website I created for an assignment at Experis Academy using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Bank functionality
There is a bank account which can be used to buy a new computer. The user can by working and getting salary transfer this money to the bank account. 
The user can also take a loan and if there´s an active loan then the salary is used to either repay a part of the loan or the entire loan.

## Computers 
A list of computers is fetched from a web API. The information of each computer is then displayed on the website. One of the laptops had a image url which didn´t work. To solve this I added a default image that was displayed to the user instead.
